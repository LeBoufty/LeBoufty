## Welcome to my palace !

My name is Pauline and I graduated from [TELECOM Nancy](https://telecomnancy.univ-lorraine.fr/) in the IL (Software Engineering) specialization.

I mostly specialize in backend development (with the very little experience I have), though I am trying to learn Godot as all the amazing ideas I write tons of documentation about won't code themselves.

I usually do the Advent of Code in languages I am learning ! You may see weird ones in there some time soon...
